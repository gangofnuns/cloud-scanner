# secure-scanner
Secure-scanner is series of example cases for scanning cloud infrastructure for security breaches.
It's designed to run as a series of lambdas in AWS.

It produces actionable reports with information about possible breaches and other issues. 

Eventually, it will have an alarm system that can be used for alerting.  

WARNING: Still a work in progress.
